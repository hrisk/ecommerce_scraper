# ecommerce_scraper
This is a simple e-commerce scrapper based on selenium and beautiful soup. Can be just as easily used to scrape other websites.
Create your own function, change the links to scrape in code and loop through relevant tags. 
As the selenium driver opens each window to scrape, it avoids the generic robots not allowed sort of issues which you get when scrapping.
